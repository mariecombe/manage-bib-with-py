abstract = "Three major destructive earthquakes of Ms 6.7, 6.4, 6.4 occurred in the eastern part of the Gulf of Corinth in February' and March 1981. Associated normal faulting was observed on both the north and the south sides of the Gulf. Examination of teleseismic, local seismic, surface faulting and geomorpbological data suggests that the first and second of these shocks activated major north-dipping normal faults. These faults control the topography and bathymetry and are related to the recent uplift and subsidence of the coastline. It is probable that the first earthquake occurred on a faultwhich outcrops underwater and the second on a fault which is visible on land. It appears that the third shock activated an antithetic normal fault dipping southwards on the north side of the Gulf and that the overall structure of the Gulf of Corinth graben is asymmetric. The northern antithetic fault clearly demonstrates the geomorphological changes associated with developing young normal faulting. In addition, we suggest that observations of recent coastline movement provide a powerful tool for identifying major active fault systems and predicting their historical role in the paleogeography of an area.

In the North Aegean we observe a clear difference between the thickly sedimented northern margin basins and the steep slopes of the trough margin of the southern North Aegean. The trough itself comprises a series of separate tectonic depressions resulting from an apparent transtensional motion. The Central Aegean consists of a complex tectonic puzzle caused by the prevailing extension; incipient strike-slip faulting (sub-parallel to the North Aegean trough trend) may, however, affect its eastern (Anatolian) domain. Three main structural areas characterize the Southern Aegean. Comparable structural directions cut across this chiefly extensional basin, but one fault system may be prevailing over the others, depending on the area. The Central Cretan Sea results from the interaction of at least two distinct extensions. These were superimposed on previous, mostly E-W structural trends generated during the inception of the southern Hellenic subduction and led to the present-day predominant SW-NE trending extension. As a hypothesis we propose that the overall Late Miocene-present evolution of the Aegean Sea is directly dependent on two geodynamic processes: to the southeast of the area, collision between Arabia and Turkey leads to the lateral (westward) expulsion of the Aegean continental crust, and to the west, Hellenic subduction is still active.

The timing of the extension process is consistent with the ages of oldest sea floor adjacent to these margins. Extension parameters determined from the subsidence history of the Nova Scotian margin indicate both crustal and subcrustal material extended by approximately the same amount. For Labrador, the extension parameters indicate that the mantle lithosphere was extended considerably more than the crust. The magnitudes of extension on both margins are in good agreement with observed crustal thickness determined from seismic refraction data. Profiles depicting the sedimentary stratigraphies and depth to basement were constructed across each margin. The temperature distribution within the sediments was calculated from the extension parameters using a two-dimensional model with sediment units of varying thickness, radioactive heat production, and conductivity. The calculated temperature distribution across the margins is in good agreement with bottom hole temperatures measured in deep exploratory wells, and with surface heat flow measurements where they are available. Similar plots of temperature paleotemperature within the sediments suggest that thermal conditions have been favorable for hydrocarbon generation in some of the older strata. "

This tilting is seen both in young vertical movements of the coastline, such as raised beaches and marshlands, and in the distribution of Middle Miocene marine rocks, which are uplifted to elevations of 400?500 m in footwalls of faults and found at depths of around 3500 m in the adjacent grabens. The absolute amplitude of the observed vertical motions can be approximately modelled by planar rotating normal faults that impose a saw-tooth topography on a regional subsidence caused by crustal and lithospheric thinning. The observations required for this simple model are: the present day fault dip, the amount of tilting and the width of the rotating blocks. The virtues of the model are its simplicity and its compatibility with our knowledge of how large active normal faults move elsewhere on the continents. "

The geometry of extension at crustal scale is also very similar with north-dipping normal faults connecting near the brittle?ductile transition to shallow north-dipping shear zones. This pattern of extension is not significantly modified by the recent extrusion of the motion of Anatolia and Aegea. The persistence over more than 25 Myr of the same pattern of extension suggests that the cause for extension resides within the Aegean lithosphere. Gravitational collapse allowed by extensional boundary conditions after 30 Ma (slab retreat) is the primary cause for post-orogenic extension in the Aegean and Western Anatolia. "

abstract = "We review the geodynamic evolution of the Aegean?Anatolia region and discuss strain localisation there over geological times. From Late Eocene to Present, crustal deformation in the Aegean backarc has localised progressively during slab retreat. Extension started with the formation of the Rhodope Metamorphic Core Complex (Eocene) and migrated to the Cyclades and the northern Menderes Massif (Oligocene and Miocene), accommodated by crustal-scale detachments and a first series of core complexes (MCCs). Extension then localised in Western Turkey, the Corinth Rift and the external Hellenic arc after Messinian times, while the North Anatolian Fault penetrated the Aegean Sea. Through time the direction and style of extension have not changed significantly except in terms of localisation. The contributions of progressive slab retreat and tearing, basal drag, extrusion tectonics and tectonic inheritance are discussed and we favour a model (1) where slab retreat is the main driving engine, (2) successive slab tearing episodes are the main causes of this stepwise strain localisation and (3) the inherited heterogeneity of the crust is a major factor for localising detachments. The continental crust has an inherited strong heterogeneity and crustal-scale contacts such as major thrust planes act as weak zones or as zones of contrast of resistance and viscosity that can localise later deformation. The dynamics of slabs at depth and the asthenospheric flow due to slab retreat also have influence strain localisation in the upper plate. Successive slab ruptures from the Middle Miocene to the Late Miocene have isolated a narrow strip of lithosphere, still attached to the African lithosphere below Crete. The formation of the North Anatolian Fault is partly a consequence of this evolution. The extrusion of Anatolia and the Aegean extension are partly driven from below (asthenospheric flow) and from above (extrusion of a lid of rigid crust). "

abstract = "Observations of present-day normal faulting in regions of active continental extension may be helpful when interpreting the geological record in older extensional basins. The most obvious manifestation of active extension is normal faulting in earthquakes. Earthquake foci are mostly confined to the upper (seismogenic) continental crust, whose thickness imposes a scale on the observed deformation. Large earthquakes move faults with lengths similar or large compared with the thickness of the seismogenic layer. Large seismogenic normal faults on the continents appear to be restricted to a dip range of around 30?60�: dips significantly gentler than 20� have not been observed in fault plane solutions of large earthquakes. Large seismographic normal faults are approximately planar in cross-section and cut through the base of the upper seismogenic layer, rotating about a horizontal axis as they move. A reasonable estimate of the regional extension can often be made from the dip of the large normal faults and the tilt of the blocks they bound (the ?domino model?). Such faults are rarely continuous for more than 15?20 km, but commonly change strike or step in an en �chelon fashion. This segmentation may occur on a scale controlled by the thickness of the seismogenic layer, and is an important influence on sedimentation and drainage. These observations are common to large seismogenic normal faults from a variety of tectonic settings, and suggest that the kinematics of normal faulting may not be strongly influenced by the forces responsible for the extension, which can vary widely in nature and magnitude. Small earthquakes, which move faults that are small compared with the seismogenic layer thickness, show no simple pattern and often can be interpreted as internal deformation of blocks bounded by large faults. In some places the seismogenic basement faults do not reach the surface but are decoupled from the sedimentary cover by layers of weak lithology. Faults in the sedimentary cover may be strongly curved in cross-section, requiring their hangingwalls to deform internally. Estimating extension from such faults is not straightforward and requires a knowledge of the hangingwall deformation. Estimates made in this way are often very non-unique and prone to large errors. We postulate that the thickness of the seismogenic upper crust controls both the maximum length of large normal fault segments along strike and the maximum size of blocks that can rotate coherently about a horizontal axis.

abstract = "A new tectonic model for the Aegean block is outlined in an effort to explain the widespread extension observed in this region. A key element in this model is the concept of ?side arc collision? This term is used to describe the interaction of subducted oceanic lithosphere with continental lithosphere in a subduction arc in which oblique subduction occurs. In the Hellenic arc side arc collision is proposed for the northeast corner near Rhodes. The collision involves subducted African lithosphere, moving to the northeast almost parallel to the arc, with the continental mass of southwest Turkey. It affects the motion of the Anatolian-Aegean plate complex, but is not similar to continental collision since it occurs mostly at depth and involves only little, if any, of the shallow and rigid part of the continental lithosphere. The model assumes that Anatolia and the Aegean are part of one plate complex which undergoes counterclockwise rotation; if it were not for the side arc collision near Rhodes, the two blocks would exhibit similar deformation and might, in effect, be indistinguishable. At present, however, free and undisturbed rotation is possible only for the Anatolian block (excluding western Anatolia) where the motion is accommodated by subduction along the Cyprean arc. Further west the side arc collision inhibits this rotation along the subduction front. Still further west, undisturbed subduction along the central and western parts of the Hellenic arc is again possible and is well documented. On the other side of the Anatolian-Aegean plate complex, relatively free motion occurs along the North Anatolian fault zone including in the Aegean Sea. The combination of this motion in the north with the local obstruction of the rotation near Rhodes, must create a torque and a new pattern of rotation for the western part of the plate complex, thus creating a separate Aegean block. Since, however, the two blocks are not separated by a plate boundary, the Aegean block cannot move freely according to the new torque. Effective motion of the Aegean block relative to Europe and Anatolia, particularly in the north, is achieved through extension of the crust (lithosphere?). Thus the greatest amount of deformation (extension) is observed along the suture zone between the two blocks and, in particular, in the northeastern part of the Aegean block where motion relative to Anatolia must be greatest.

A kinematic model combining two orthogonal shear components is proposed to explain such a strain pattern. It is concluded that the observed strain trajectories result from a combination of a southward thrusting and a sinistral wrenching. This conclusion is in good agreement with previous conclusions gained by several local microtectonic studies. The geodynamic significance of combined thrusting and wrenching at the scale of the Ibero-Armorican arc is discussed, and a progressive deformation model is proposed. "

Five regional tectonic maps are used as the basis for a new stress map for the Aegean region and for discussions on regional geodynamics. Since the Late Miocene, the central Aegean has been affected by WNW- and NE-trending faults which transfer the motion of the Anatolian plate to the southwest, synchronous with arc-normal pull acting on the boundary of the Aegean plate. At the same time, the Hellenic Peninsula has suffered moderate extension by NW-trending grabens formed due to collapse of the Hellenic mountain chain. During intense extension in the southern Aegean in the Plio-Quaternary the arcuate shape of the Hellenic Trench was established. Arc-normal pull in the Aegean plate margin, combined with transform resistive forces along the Hellenic subduction gave rise to widespread strike-slip and oblique-normal faults in the eastern segment and moderate oblique extension in the western segment of the arc. To the north, subduction involves more continental crust and consequently the push of subduction is transmitted to the overriding plate (Hellenic Peninsula), resulting in the formation of NE-trending grabens. WNW-trending grabens in this area are considered to have propagated westward from the Aegean Sea to the Ionian Sea during Plio-Quaternary times, probably acting as pull-apart structures between stable Europe and the rapidly extending southern Aegean area.

This is mainly because this region is characterised by low seismicity rates and is poorly covered by \{GPS\} stations. Here, we analyse new homogeneous \{GPS\} data collected over a period of 5.5 years from the first permanent network in northeast Greece (HEPOS) to shed light in the kinematics of this region. We find that \{GPS\} displacement vectors that derive from either side of the natural depression of the Strymon Valley differ significantly in orientation and magnitude. Specifically, we find that across a distance of ca. 30 km the \{GPS\} displacement vectors change orientation by &gt; 130� (from \{NNW\} to SSW), producing a mean horizontal strain rate of 3.3 � 0.3 mm/yr. We attribute this kinematic translation to result from movement along the Strymon Fault System (SFS), a &gt; 200 km-long structure that strikes NW-SE and extends from \{SW\} Bulgaria to North Aegean (where possibly abuts against the North Anatolian Fault). Up to date, the \{SFS\} was considered to be a major Alpine and Neogene geotectonic boundary of unclear Holocene activity. If the interseismic strain stored currently across the fault system is released seismically, large earthquakes (M &gt; 7) and associated coseismic lateral displacements should be expected in the area. These results call for a better assessment of the earthquake risk in northeast Greece, which is currently evaluated as a low seismic hazard region. "

This \{CAI\} consists mainly of gehlenitic melilite, spinel, perovskite, and hibonite. CaAl4O7 is a minor component and occurs within melilite preferentially in portions rich in perovskite. The \{CAI\} is enveloped by a succession of three rims (from inside out): (a) hibonite+melilite+spinel+perovskite, (b) diopside, and (c) olivine. On the basis of mineral associations found and from the presence of moderately volatile elements (Fe and Cr) we conclude that the CaAl4O7-bearing \{CAI\} from Leoville is of residual nature. CaAl4O7 is apparently stable in the very Mg- and Si-poor environment of this \{CAI\} and is probably of igneous origin. The rims are interpreted as products of partial evaporation (rim (a)) and associated re-condensation (rims (b) and (c)). "

Interpretations based on local ground conditions, structural properties of buildings and peculiarities of the rupture process lead to a re-evaluation of the macroseismic field configuration. This, together with the aftershock epicentral distribution, quite well defines the earthquake rupture zone, which trends NE-SW and coincides with the Amorgos Astypalea trough. The lateral extent of the rupture zone, however, is about 40% smaller than that predicted for Aegean earthquakes of Ms = 7.4. This discrepancy could be attributed to sea-bottom topography changes, which seem to control the rupture terminations, and to relatively high stressdrop with respect to other Aegean earthquakes. Fault plane solutions obtained by several authors indicate either mainly normal faulting with a significant right-lateral strike-slip component or predominantly strike-slip motion. The neotectonism of Amorgos Island, based on new field observations, aerial photograph analysis and fault mechanisms, is consistent with the dip-slip interpretation. The neotectonic master fault of Amorgos and the 1956 seismic faulting appear to belong to the same tectonic phase (NE-SW strike and a southeasterly dip). However, the significant right-lateral strike-slip component supports the idea that the Amorgos region deviates from the simple description for pure extension in back-arc conditions. "

By comparing fault slip rates estimated from geomorphological data with current extension rates known from geodetic measurements, it appears that the newest faults can account for effectively all the present-day motions. Fault migration of this sort is easy to recognize in young systems close to sea level, because vertical movements of footwalls and hanging walls are obvious and reveal which faults are currently most active, but is less easy to confirm away from reliable reference levels or in older terrains with poorer time resolution. It is probably more common than is appreciated, and has a profound effect on syn-rift sedimentation and erosion patterns. Fault migration is probably an inevitable consequence of the interplay between stresses generated by the fault-related topography and the ultimate strength of major faults. It is likely to be further encouraged in places where lower crustal flow or rotations about a vertical axis are important. However, it is not clear why migration should preferentially occur into the hanging walls, as observed in central Greece. "

The type of faulting was determined for all these zones by the use of reliable fault plane solutions, which are available for this area.

The estimation of the deformation velocities is not performed in broad seismic zones but in seismogenic sources of limited spatial extent, where the seismic energy is practically released, in order to describe the spatial variations of the components of the strain rate tensor. The deformation analysis is based on previous work where the seismicity and the available focal mechanisms are used separately for estimating the rate and shape of the deformation, respectively. The calculations were performed for 63 seismogenic sources identified in the Aegean sea and surrounding area which belong to eight belts with an almost uniform orientation of the stress field. Along the coasts of Albania and northwestern Greece (up to Leukada island) the collision of the Adria plate with Eurasia results in a compressional velocity of about 4 mm/yr in a direction (N49�E) almost normal to the coast line. The dextral movement with almost 3 cm/yr along the Cephalonia transform fault with strike N45�E is expressed as an almost equal extension and compression in N-S and E-W direction, respectively. Along the convex (outer) part of the Hellenic arc a crustal shortening of 1.3 cm/yr is observed in a mean direction N34�E. The direction of this shortening is almost constant from the southern Ionian islands (Zakynthos) up to Rodos while the shortening rate does not significantly change from the outer sources to the inner ones. The Aegean sea and surrounding area is characterised by an extensional deformation. The direction of the maximum extension in the northern part of this area shows an anticlockwise rotation from east to west. Thus, this extension has a \{NNE\} direction in northwestern Turkey (N11�E), a \{NNW\} direction in central and northern Greece as well as along the southern Aegean volcanic arc and its extension to southwestern Turkey (N12�W) and a \{WNW\} direction in the westernmost part of this extensional area (N72�W). The mean value of the extensional velocities in this area is 5 mm/yr. The northern part of Asia Minor and of the Aegean sea is characterised by the dextral strike-slip movement of about 2 cm/yr of the North Anatolian fault and its continuation in the northern Aegean, where this movement gradually decreases to about 6 mm/yr. The vertical crustal (upper 10 km of the crust) thickening is about 2 mm/yr along the convex side of the Hellenic arc and the vertical crustal thinning is about 1 mm/yr in the Aegean sea. These values were obtained from the component \{U33\} of the velocity tensor. "

Though direct information from the basin itself is meagre, the geology of its passive margins and the regional framework of the Tethys evolution constrain the formation and history of the basin. The Eastern Mediterranean and its passive margins are interpreted to have formed as a result of several faulting and continental breakup phases from Early Permian to Middle Jurassic times, before Pangaea's complete disintegration. This led to the detachment of the Eratosthenes and Tauride blocks from the margins of the Levant and Herodotus basins, respectively. The latter merged in the northeast with the Cyprus basin that extended along Arabia's northern margin. The main rifting probably occurred in the Triassic, leading to seafloor spreading in the Herodotus and Cyprus basins, while along the Levant margin important rifting also occurred in the Jurassic. During the initial rifting stages extension perpendicular to the Levant margin was important, but subsequently the Tauride block drifted mainly northward. The existence of the passive margins and slopes of the Eastern Mediterranean is documented at least from the end of the Middle Jurassic. Until then the basin was probably narrow (?200?300 km?), but during the main phase of the Africa?Laurasia separation it grew to twice its present width, or more. This scenario depends critically on the interpretation that the Tauride block was originally located next to northeastern Africa on the western side of the Eratosthenes block. Plate convergence and consumption of the northern portion of the basin have taken place since mid-Cretaceous times, but the active convergent boundary on its northern side formed only in the Neogene by modification of earlier structures. Some intra-plate deformation also took place, especially in the Neogene, but it hardly changed the original configuration of the remaining portion of the basin. "

Some recent tectonic maps show the Isparta Angle as a NW?SE compressional lineament extending eastwards into the Kyrenia Range of northern Cyprus. However, fault data from the onshore Isparta Angle, together with offshore shallow seismic reflection data, show that the present morpho-tectonic setting is dominated by extension. The last phase of compression to affect the area studied in the Late Miocene, was accompanied by regional nappe emplacement (Lycian Nappes). Onshore, fault planes, measured from fault zones bounding both the limbs and the core of the Isparta Angle are oriented predominantly NE?SW, NW?SE and N?S. Superimposed slickenfibres show that reverse faults were succeeded, in turn, by right-lateral faults, then by normal faults. The fault phases are dated by stratigraphical and geomorphological evidence. Reverse faults date from the Late Miocene, or earlier compressional deformation, whereas the right-lateral faults mainly developed during latest Miocene?Early Pliocene. Normal faulting dominated from the Late Pliocene?Recent. An interpretation of shallow seismic reflection data shows that Antalya Bay is characterised by a NW?SE-trending asymmetrical graben system that has continued to be active. During the Late Miocene?Early Pliocene right-lateral strike-slip resulted from shear along the eastern termination of a zone of extension and rotation that characterises the western Aegean. This shear was focused in a N?S direction by inherited zones of structural weakness in the basement (Antalya Complex). The switch to NE?SW extension in the Late Pliocene?Quaternary relates to a regional change in stress direction throughout the Aegean region and was accompanied by strong uplift of the Bey Da?lar? region of the Taurus Mountains, bordering the Isparta Angle in the west. The Isparta Angle is the link between: (a) the extensional province of western Turkey bounded to the south by the actively subducting Hellenic arc; and (b) the uplifted Anatolian plateau bounded to the south by the Cyprus subduction zone. Understanding the Miocene to Recent tectonic development helps elucidate the kinematics of the region. The new structural data presented lend no support for recent suggestions that the Isparta Angle and Antalya Bay represent parts of a regional compressional zone related to plate collision. "

These results can be considered to be complementary, in resolution and coverage, to the previously published long-range side-scan sonar (Gloria) results. A characteristic of the Mediterranean ridge is the presence over about half of its surface of an extensive fold system affecting the Messinian and Plio-Quaternary cover, which is dissected by conjugate strike-slip faults. The resolution of Sea-Beam was used to map the main characteristics of folding and faulting. This analysis, together with previously available data, enables us to define the strain pattern over the Mediterranean ridge. We thus now have an overall view of the strain pattern from a marginal basin (Aegea) through the Hellenic trench and adjacent sea-floor to the opposite continent. The bottom of the Hellenic trench is a boundary between an extensional domain to the north and a compressional one to the south. The southern domain is strongly affected by the presence of the Lybian promontary. It is related to the formation of an accretionary ridge due to the inability of the upper 3?4 km of sediments to subduct. This ridge is similar to the accretionary prism but it is much wider with respect to its height, probably because of the existence of a decollement over a level of overpressure. The Hellenic trench then is in the situation of a fore-arc basin. Its origin is due to the fact that the Aegean continental slope is not vertical but rather has a small 4� dip. As a result, a sedimentary wedge, symmetric but shorter than the main accretionary wedge develops over the buried portion of the slope. It is characterized by landward thrusts. Such an origin probably applies to fore-arc basins in general. "

The study area stretches from Mexico City on the east to the Gulf of California on the west, between 17� and 21� N latitude. Fault scarps of Plio-Quaternary age define several large scale tectonic features within the Mexican Volcanic Belt, dominated by rifting, transtension, and shear, with probable sinistral components. Three large crustal blocks south of the Mexican Volcanic Belt are separated from the North American plate and from each other by zones of neotectonic activity that express the relative motions between the adjacent blocks. A simple vector diagram for plates and crustal blocks in central Mexico has been constructed using information from the literature combined with the orientations of fault zones as mapped in this study. The relative motion between the blocks varies from about 2.5 to 8 mm year?1, which is comparable to motions of crustal blocks in areas of active rifting in other parts of the world. In the Mexican Volcanic Belt, there is a clear relationship between volcanism and neotectonic activity. Fault zones that traverse nearly the entire region have the same location and orientation as the volcanic belt. This may indicate that deformation within the crust of the overriding slab plays a significant role in determining the unusual orientation of the Mexican Volcanic Belt relative to the trench. The ultimate factor controlling the location of Plio-Quaternary volcanism and tectonism in central Mexico may be large zones of crustal weakness formed during major Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic events.

Numerical modeling involved 2D elastic elements in a plane-stress approximation. The model is constituted by a mosaic of poorly deformable blocks separated by much more deformable decoupling zones, representing consuming boundaries, extensional zones and transcurrent discontinuities, whose location and geometry have been deduced by neotectonic, morphological and seismological information. The calculated displacement field obtained with the modeling parametrization which allows to match the observed strain regimes is compatible with geodetic observations in the study area, but for the Hellenic Arc, where geodetic velocities are higher than those predicted by modeling. This discrepancy could be considerably reduced by adopting a higher deformability of the model in the Hellenic trench, but this condition would contrast with the Plio-Quaternary deformation pattern of the southern Aegean zone, which suggest a considerable slowdown of western Crete since the late Pliocene. Furthermore, geodetic velocities are considerably higher than the motion rates derived by moment tensor analysis in the Hellenic trench and in the internal Aegean area and cannot easily account for the low Quaternary deformation observed in the southern Aegean zone. The above discrepancy could be due to a difference between the ?instantaneous? kinematic behavior of the Aegean zone, indicated by geodetic measurements, and the average behavior over longer time intervals, inferred from geological and seismological strain indicators.

It continues onward beneath the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and determines the boundary of the Antalya and Adana basins as far as to the west of Cyprus.

The easternmost part of the Anatolian Platelet is being deformed internally by several dextral to sinistral intraplate strike-slip faults. These are the Lake Salt Fault Zone (LSFZ), the Salanda Fault (SF), the CAFZ, the G�ksu-Yazyurdu Fault Zone (GYFZ) and the Malatya-Ovacik Fault Zone (MOFZ). They take up lesser motion and are younger than boundary faults of the Anatolian Platelet. The \{GYFZ\} and \{MOFZ\} splay from the NATF, cut across the Anatolian Platelet and then meet to the EATF. Whereas, other faults are confined into the Anatolian Platelet and seem to be independent structures. However, present-day structural pattern of all these intraplate faults and boundary faults of the Anatolian Platelet indicates a regional strain pattern of NNW-SSE-directed shortening and ENE-WSW-directed extension, and they seem to have developed to accommodate northward motion of the Arabian Plate since late Early Pliocene times.

The field was observed to be the product of various morphological transformations, different developments and different elements and processes with a topography which has various landforms and polycyclic features due to a lengthy and discontinuous process. Time concept which started with the first lithological storage in Lower Ordovician continued with the deformation related to the right lateral heave around the Marmara Sea and with the clockwise rotation of the study area in Middle-Upper Miocene.

These rocks are also compared with Miocene Galatean volcanics (GVP) from central Anatolia. The NAEM, \{SAVA\} and \{GVP\} show similar geochemical features indicative of a subduction-related origin in which subducted oceanic plate contaminated the overlying mantle wedge. The distinct geochemical features of the \{AOMM\} reflect derivation from an intensely metasomatised mantle source, resulting from partial subduction and accretion of both continental and oceanic assemblages in the fore-arc of a southward migrating subduction system. These features provide an insight into the history of the distinct types of mantle metasomatism in the region and into its geodynamic evolution ? an evolution that include complex interaction of subduction roll-back, slab break-off, strike-slip faulting along major transfer zones, block rotations and core complex formation. Thus, the Eocene to recent magmatism in the region was controlled by various tectonic events: (1) the \{NAEM\} was most probably related to break-off of the subducted slab in western Anatolia, (2) magmatic activity in the western \{AOMM\} was controlled by rotational extension around poles in northern Greece developed in response to rotational roll-back of the Hellenic subduction system, (3) while \{AOMM\} magmatism in the east is closely associated with core complex formation and asthenosphere-related thermal input along a ~ N?S-trending slab tear. In contrast, the rocks of the \{DIV\} and \{IPV\} carry asthenospheric mantle geochemical signatures indicative of roll-back induced asthenospheric upwelling in Rhodope to \{NW\} Anatolia, and slab tear-induced asthenospheric upwelling beneath the Menderes Core Complex.

In the past ?0.6�Ma, sea-level change has been dominated by asymmetric 100�ka eustatic sea-level cycles, whereas the record of sea-level changes in earlier Pleistocene progradational sequences is less clear. In a steadily subsiding basin in which accommodation balances sediment flux, the depth of a eustatic lowstand determines the paleo-depth of the deepest clinoform inflection point and the seaward limit of the erosional transgressive surface, whereas the duration of a lowstand controls the amount of progradation that takes place. We report high-resolution seismic profiles of an exceptionally preserved coastal progradational sequence from a coastal embayment in the Aegean Sea that is subsiding at ?100�m/Ma. The seismic profiles show clinoforms of smaller amplitude and volume that were deposited before the 100�ka cyclic progradational units. This contrasts with literature reports of complexity in progradational sequences at that time. We assume that published stacked benthic foram O-isotope records are a good proxy for the duration and a reasonable proxy for the amplitude of Pleistocene eustatic sea-level cycles. The \{MIS\} 6?5 eustatic sea-level rise is recognised based on sedimentation rates from cores. The underlying major progradational units are correlated with the long-duration, extreme lowstand 100�ka cycles of \{MIS\} 6, 12 and 16. Changes in the elevation of lowstand inflection points in clinoforms are used to tentatively extend the record back to \{MIS\} 38, by comparison with the benthic foram proxy. The deposits of the higher and longer highstands of \{MIS\} 25, 31 and 37 are also recognised. This record provides a testable template for future studies of short early Pleistocene sections on land and raises questions of detail about parts of the published ?18O records. It independently supports the recent evidence that the Mid-Pleistocene transition was an abrupt event, with an extreme lowstand in \{MIS\} 22. "

The main active faults on each island are described in terms of their geometrical characteristics and geomorphology. Faults that comply with specific criteria (geological age, effect on relief, their geometrical relationship to the active stress field) have been characterized as active. We evaluated and reviewed published information, augmented with new field data for onshore faults, while the effects of faulting on the sea-floor and their probable association with recorded earthquakes were used to determine offshore faulting. The relation of active faulting to the stress pattern has been examined as well. It is shown that as the deformation changes gradually from transtensional in the north to extensional in the south, so does the active faulting pattern. The effect of the westernmost splays of the North Anatolian Fault Zone, the largest of which is the ~ 300 km long, North Aegean Trough, is profound due to their close vicinity, causing shearing in good agreement with the modeled principal displacement zone deformation pattern. Faulting in the area is controlled by the distance from the main dextral principal displacement zones: the northern part of the area is directly affected by the North Anatolian Fault Zone and its splays, while this effect gradually weakens in the central and southern areas. The geomorphology responds to this faulting, causing the formation of fault-parallel gulfs near Lesvos and Lemnos and fault-defined shorelines in the rest of the islands. Ikaria exhibits a notable fault-controlled tilted topography as the result of footwall uplift. "

A better neotectonic framework and knowledge on the paleostress evolution of the Strait of Gibraltar area is necessary to find the local sources for those events and to establish an understanding of the recent deformation. Paleoseismic evidence for one moderate earthquake event around 6000-5000 \{BP\} along the normal Carrizales Fault is described in this paper. Off-shore high-resolution seismic investigations, structural and paleostress data, high-resolution \{GPR\} and geoelectrical resistivity measurements, outcrop investigations and trenching studies are discussed. The data reveal that active faulting takes place along N?S trending normal faults. Hence, N?S directed normal faults in the area are claimed as local candidates for moderate earthquake activity. Return periods of moderate earthquakes in the order of at least 2000?2500 years in the study area may have to be taken into account.

Radiocarbon ages determined for corals and bryozoans exposed between the paleo-shoreline and present sea level are consistent, within measurement error, with each other and with the date of the earthquake. But radiocarbon ages determined for the boring bivalve Lithophaga lithophaga found on the same substrate are at least 350 years, and up to 2000 years, older than the date of the earthquake that lifted them above sea level. These observations reveal two important effects that limit the use of radiocarbon lithophagid ages in tectonic and paleoseismological studies. The first is that the exceptional preservation potential of lithophagids allows them to remain intact and in situ long after natural death, while the substrate continues to be colonised until eventual uplift. The second, which we confirm with radiocarbon analysis of museum specimens of known age, is the incorporation of old (14C-free) carbon into lithophagid shells from the limestone host rock into which the lithophagids bored. The two effects are both significant in Crete and central Greece, and can cause the radiocarbon lithophagid ages to be up to 2000 years older than the uplift event which exposed them. Understanding these effects is important because lithophagids are far more abundantly preserved, and used to date uplift, than most other marine organisms. This study shows that they can rarely be used to distinguish uplift events, or date them to better than 1000 years, or even to distinguish whether observed uplift occurred in a single or in multiple events. After taking account of these uncertainties, the ages of the lithophagids are, however, consistent with the hypothesis that the highest prominent marine notches and exposed lithophagid holes within a few metres of sea level in Greece formed when sea level became relatively stable ~ 6000 years ago, following rapid rise after the last glacial maximum.

This study investigates the rheological properties of the 1956 rupture zone between Amorgos and Santorini islands, in an effort to place some constraints on the nucleation depth and rupture extent of this large event. The seismic velocities inferred from tomographic and surface wave dispersion studies of the area are first correlated with laboratory determined velocities of known rock types. It is found that the lithosphere in the southern Aegean can be approximated by three layers representing the upper/lower crust and upper mantle consisting of quartzite, diabase and peridotite, respectively. Geotherms are calculated by using an analytical solution to the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, while Yield Strength Envelopes (YSEs) are produced after assuming laboratory estimated parameters of brittle and ductile deformation for each rock type. The depth frequency of earthquakes in the area, as well as other independent observations favour the \{YSE\} calculated for a wet upper crust/upper mantle, a dry lower crust and a geotherm corresponding to a surface heat flow of 62 mW m?2. In this YSE, the upper mantle exhibits maximum strength at 33 km becoming more ductile at greater depths. The lower crust retains significant strength and therefore cannot flow as it did during the early stages of extension, but it is relatively weaker than the upper mantle confirming the ?jelly sandwich? model previously proposed for the continental lithosphere. The downdip rupture width of the Amorgos event can be estimated from empirical relationships to be 26 km which means that its rupture may have extended from the depth of peak strength in the upper mantle (33 km) to 7 km upwards. Such a scenario agrees well with recent modelling results indicating that the Amorgos tsunami was probably caused by submarine landslides rather than coseismic rupture of the seafloor. "

Furthermore, the fact that in our scheme Adria moves almost in connection with Africa is consistent with the lack of an active decoupling zone between Adria and Africa, an evidence that can hardly be reconciled with the kinematics so far proposed for these two plates. The reasons why we adopt an Africa?Eurasia relative motion different from that implied by the popular NUVEL-1 global solution are discussed in detail. Finally, we make some considerations about the possible implications of the presently available geodetic data on the long-term plate kinematics. "

We investigate the tectonically active region of Attica (Greece) in the Aegean back arc as a model region to show how basins and mountain ranges commonly thought to be formed by movements on high-angle normal faults in fact reflect the surface expression of displacements on yet undetected, deep-seated, active low-angle normal detachment faults. Inferences are made based on an integrated study of Attica linking the petrology of clastic sediments with geomorphology and structures, and including few new palynological data. From the Miocene to Recent, three sets of normal detachment fault systems were successively active. Shear zones of the 1st (Early Miocene) stage emplaced rocks of the Attic Cycladic high-P metamorphic belt (AC-HP-belt) from depth corresponding to greeschist facies conditions in the brittle, upper crust. In the 2nd stage the \{WNW\} dipping Attica low-angle normal detachment fault system between the AC-HP-belt and the un- or weakly metamorphosed rocks of the sub-Pelagonian Zone (SPZ) was active. Clastic sedimentation started in the Late Miocene, during the 2nd stage. Late Miocene and Early Pliocene clastic sediments reveal that during the 2nd stage many areas that presently expose the AC-HP-belt were still covered by the overlying SPZ. Also, now uplifted areas such as the Parnitha mountain range that currently undergo strong erosion were then the sites of sedimentary sinks. The 3rd stage (Late Pliocene through Recent) is associated with dramatic changes in the morphology and recurring steepening of the relief. Reversal of the Parnitha area from the site of deposition into the site of erosion is associated with deposition of coarse conglomerates to the \{SE\} of the Parnitha Mt. and S of the Penteli Mt. Sediments of the 3rd stage reflect activity of the here newly described, SSE-dipping Penteli?Athens low-angle detachment fault (PADF) system formed at a high angle to the Attica detachment fault. The outcome of this study is that the present-day geomorphology is to a high degree related to the operation of the \{PADF\} system. Steep fault bounding the Athens and Mesogea basins as well as the mountain ranges (Parnitha, Penteli, Hymittos mounts) belongs to its breakaway zone or root into the PADF. Ongoing tectonic movements related to this fault system were responsible for the 1999 Athens (Mw = 6.0) earthquake. We particularly discuss how the \{PADF\} may continue into greater depth, the translation magnitude, and how the \{PADF\} fits into the wider kinematic framework of the Aegean region. "

Here these models are questioned. We alternatively present a number of geodynamic and magmatic constraints suggesting a simple model for the genesis of the extension as being related to the differential advancement of the upper lithosphere over a heterogeneous lower African plate. The Greek microplate overrides the Ionian oceanic segment of the African plate faster than the Anatolian microplate over the thicker Levantine more continental segment. This setting is evidenced by GPS-velocity gradient in the hangingwall of the Hellenic?Cyprus subduction system and requires a zone of rifting splitting the hangingwall into two microplates. This mechanism is unrelated to the replacement of retreated slab by the asthenosphere as typically occurs in the backarc of west-directed subduction zones. The supposed greater dehydration of the Ionian segment of the slab is providing a larger amount of fluids into the low velocity channel at the top of the asthenosphere, allowing a faster decoupling between the Greek microplate and the underlying mantle with respect to the Anatolian microplate. Slab ruptures associated with the differential retreat controlled by the inherited lithospheric heterogeneities in the lower plate and the proposed upwelling of the mantle suggested by global circulation models would explain the occurrence and coexistence of slab-related and slab-unrelated magmatism.

The pre-existing mixture of the above tectono-stratigaphic units in a single complex created a number of misinterpretations as far as stratigraphy, metamorphism and interpretation of low angle faults as thrusts or detachments. Especially in cases where the inferred tectonic contact concerns the transition between the Tyros Beds and the base of the Tripolis carbonate platform there is no structural omission and therefore the contact represents a minor disharmonic sliding surface and not a detachment. Based on the revised tectono-stratigraphic analysis the determination of the structural omission for each tectonic contact was possible and several detachments were described for the first time. Footwall rocks of the detachments comprised several tectonic units usually from the lower nappes and hanging wall rocks comprised several tectonic units usually from the upper nappes. The detachment may separate not only metamorphosed units in the footwall (Mani, Western Crete, Arna) from non metamorphosed units in the hanging wall (Tripolis, Pindos and higher nappes) but also all other possible combinations from the Cretan nappe pile. Extension in Crete started in the Middle?Late Miocene with the formation of extensional detachment faults. The reported extensional structures of Oligocene to Early Miocene age do not correspond to crustal extension of Crete but to localized shear zones related to nappe stacking and the exhumation of metamorphic rocks. Extensional detachments in Crete form a tectonic horst through two oppositely dipping E?W-trending zones; one dipping north, related to the opening of the Cretan basin, and the other dipping south, related to the formation of the Messara supra-detachment basin. The deformation history of units within Crete can be summarized as: (i) compressional deformation producing arc-parallel east?west-trending south-directed thrust faults in Oligocene to Early Miocene time; (ii) extensional deformation along arc-parallel, east?west-trending detachment faults in Middle Miocene time, with hanging wall motion to the north and south; and (iii) Late Miocene?Quaternary transtensional deformation along high-angle normal and oblique normal faults that disrupt the older arc-parallel structures.

This ocean closed in Europe in the west during the Variscan orogeny, whereas in Asia further east it remained open and evolved into the Mesozoic Tethys, only finally closing during Late Cretaceous?Early Cenozoic. Three Upper Palaeozoic lithological assemblages, the Chios Melange (on the Aegean Greek island), the Karaburun Melange (westernmost Aegean Turkey) and the Teke Dere Unit (Lycian Nappes, \{SW\} Turkey) provide critical information concerning sedimentary and tectonic processes during closure of Palaeotethys. The Chios and Karaburun melanges in the west are mainly terrigenous turbidites with blocks and dismembered sheets of Silurian?Upper Carboniferous platform carbonate rocks (shallow-water and slope facies) and poorly dated volcanic rocks. The Teke Dere Unit to the southeast begins with alkaline, within-plate-type volcanics, depositionally overlain by Upper Carboniferous shallow-water carbonates. This intact succession is overlain by a tectonic slice complex comprising sandstone turbidites that are intersliced with shallow-water, slope and deep-sea sediments (locally dated as Early Carboniferous). Sandstone petrography and published detrital mineral dating imply derivation from units affected by the Panafrican (Cadomian) and Variscan orogenies. All three units are interpreted as parts of subduction complexes in which pervasive shear zones separate component parts. Silurian?Lower Carboniferous black cherts (lydites) and slope carbonates accreted in a subduction trench where sandstone turbidites accumulated. Some blocks retain primary depositional contacts, showing that gravitational processes contributed to formation of the melange. Detached blocks of Upper Palaeozoic shallow-water carbonates (e.g. Chios) are commonly mantled by conglomerates, which include water-worn clasts of black chert. The carbonate blocks are restored as one, or several, carbonate platforms that collided with an active margin, fragmenting into elongate blocks that slid into a subduction trench. This material was tectonically accreted at shallow levels within a subduction complex, resulting in layer-parallel extension, shearing and slicing. The accretion mainly took place during Late Carboniferous time. Alternative sedimentary-tectonic models are considered in which the timing and extent of closure of Palaeotethys differ, and in which subduction was either northwards towards Eurasia, or southwards towards Gondwana (or both). Terrane displacement is also an option. A similar (but metamorphosed) accretionary unit, the Konya Complex, occurs hundreds of kilometres further east. All of these units appear to have been assembled along the northern margin of Gondwana by Permian time, followed by deposition of overlying Tauride-type carbonate platforms. Northward subduction of Palaeotethys beneath Eurasia is commonly proposed. However, the accretionary units studied here are more easily explained by southward subduction towards Gondwana. Palaeotethys was possibly consumed by long-lived (Late Palaeozoic) northward subduction beneath Eurasia, coupled with more short-lived (Late Carboniferous) southward subduction near Gondwana, during or soon after closure of Palaeotethys in the Balkan region to the west.

High-resolution seismic profiling (AirGun, Sparker and 3.5 kHz) have shown that (at least) four major oblique prograding sequences can be traced below the Aegean marginal slopes at increasing subbottom depths. These palaeo-shelf break glacial delta sediments have been developed during successive low sea-level stands (LST prograding sequences), suggesting continuous and gradual subsidence of the Aegean margins during the last 400 ka. Subsidence rates of the Aegean margins were calculated from the vertical displacement of successive topset-to-foreset transitions (palaeo-shelf break) of the \{LST\} prograding sediment sequences. The estimated subsidence rates that were calculated in the active boundaries of the Aegean microplate (North Aegean margins, Gulfs of Patras and Corinth) are high and range from 0.7 to 1.88 m ka?1, while the lowest values (0.34?0.60 m ka?1) are related to the low tectonic and seismic activity margins like the margin of Cyclades plateau. Lower subsidence rates (0.34?0.90 m ka?1) were estimated for the period 146?18 ka \{BP\} (oxygen isotopic stages 6?2) and higher (1.46?1.88 m ka?1) for the period from 425 to 250 ka \{BP\} (oxygen isotopic stages 12/10?8). A decrease of about 50% of the subduction rates in the Aegean margins was observed during the last 400 ka. During the isotopic stages 8, 10, 11 and 12, almost the 50?60% of the present Aegean Sea was land with extensive drainage systems and delta plains and large lakes in the central and North Aegean. Marine transgression in the North Aegean was rather occurred during the isotopic 9 interglacial period. The estimated palaeomorphology should imply fan delta development and sediment failures in the steep escarpments of the North Aegean margins and high sedimentation rates and turbidite sediment accumulation in the basins. It is deduced that the Black Sea was isolated from the Mediterranean during the Pleistocene prior oxygen isotopic stage 5. "

In an effort to minimize the tectonic contributions, our study of sea-level changes in the Aegean Sea within historical times is focused on the aseismic Attico?Cycladic geotectonic zone. On the basis of archaeological information and radiocarbon dating of coastal sedimentological formations, a sea-level curve for the Attico?Cycladic massif has been constructed for the past 5000�years and compared with existing curves. According to this curve, the rapid increase of sea level concluded prior to 5.5�ka and was followed by a slow steady rise at a rate of 0.9�mm/a up to its present stage. The latter is attributed primarily to the process of thermal expansion and secondarily to the residual melting of the glaciers and existing ice-caps. By extrapolation of the curve, the sea level at the end of the 20th century is predicted to be about 9�cm higher than the present level; this value is much lower than the prediction of the last \{IPCC\} report (49�cm). If higher \{SLR\} rates are realised in the next few decades, then the excess 40�cm of the \{IPCC\} prediction can be attributed to human-induced global climatic change. "

The Ti, Cr, Al, Fe, Nb, Zr, Si, and V contents of the rutiles were obtained by electron-microprobe analyses to trace their provenance. The Cr and Nb concentrations of the analysed rutile grains show a wide range and indicate that this mineral in the Carboniferous succession is mainly derived from metamafic rocks, whereas in the Permo-Carboniferous and Permo-Triassic successions stem from a metapelitic source. The calculated formation temperatures using the Zr-in-rutile thermometer range from ca. 520 to 850��C with ?hotter? rutile being encountered in the Permo-Carboniferous and Permo-Triassic successions. This feature together with the rutile chemistry indicate a change in source-rock lithology through time, which could either reflect an increasing depth of erosion of an exhumed ?Variscan? nappe pile of heterogeneous composition in the hinterland or a change in the style of accretion and erosion of different terranes at the southern margin of Laurussia during the subduction of a branch of the Palaeotethys Ocean in the Late Palaeozoic.

Geological records of this coupling however, are usually not well preserved. Here we show a good example in eastern China where Cretaceous tectonic evolution matches remarkably well with the drifting history of the Pacific plate. The most pronounced phenomenon is that the eastern China large-scale orogenic lode gold (Au) mineralization occurred contemporaneously with an abrupt change of ~ 80� in the drifting direction of the subducting Pacific plate, concurrent with the formation of the Ontong Java Plateau. Given that lode Au deposits usually form at the onset of compressional or transpressional deformations, the Au deposits dated the major tectonic change from extension to transpression in eastern China, coherent with the subduction regime. The Cretaceous drifting history of the Pacific plate also tallies with other major geological events in eastern China, e.g., the evolution of the Tan-Lu fault and magmatic activities, suggesting that the major geological events in eastern China in the Cretaceous were mainly controlled by the subduction of the Pacific plate, and that plate interactions during subduction are important driving forces for geological evolution in eastern China and intraplate tectonics in general.

Onshore studies show the existence of several neotectonic horsts and grabens bounded by E?W trending normal faults. Thrust sheets of the underlying Hellenides crop out within the horst areas and younger sediments, mostly Lower Pleistocene, have been deposited in the grabens. The age of the marine sediments is mostly Lower Pleistocene. Throw rate on the normal faults varies between 0.7 and &gt;1.0 mm/yr, accommodating extension in the N?S direction. Subsidence rates during Early Pleistocene are between 0.1 and 0.3 mm/yr, whereas uplift rates during Middle Pleistocene?Present are between 0.18 and 0.50 mm/yr. Offshore data were obtained using bathymetric and air-gun litho-seismic profiles. The shelf has been disrupted by active faults with several meters of throw. Average Holocene throw rates are 0.4?0.6 mm/yr, but in some areas adjacent Filiatra and Olympia values greater than 3 mm/yr are detected. Holocene and Upper Pleistocene marine sediments thicken gradually to the north, as do the marine Lower Pleistocene sediments onshore. A NNW?SSE offshore longitudinal fault parallel to the Kyparissiakos coast with throw rate above 3 mm/yr is the dividing structure between the uplifted coastal area and the present-day gulf. This indicates a major change in paleogeography between Early and Middle Pleistocene. Present-day transition from E?W compression in the Hellenic Trench to E?W extension in the Kyparissiakos Gulf and to N?S extension in Western Peloponnesus is discussed. The development of E?W structures in Western Peloponnesus since Latest Pliocene may be related to the Central Hellenic Shear Zone, which accommodates differential \{GPS\} rates between Northern Greece and Southern Peloponnesus.

It shows antiform geometry in the upper crust with thickening in the lower crust. Together with the Iberian Chain it constitutes the most prominent mountainous structure of the Pyrenean foreland. The evolutionary patterns concerning the paleotopography of the interior of the Peninsula can be established by an analysis of the following data: gravimetric, topographical, macro and micro tectonic, sedimentological (infilling of the sedimentary basins of the relative foreland), P?T?t path from apatite fission tracks, paleoseismic and instrumental seismicity. Deformation is clearly asymmetric in the Central System as evidenced by the existence of an unique, large (crustal-scale) thrust at its southern border, while in the northern one there is a normal sequence of north verging thrusts, towards the Duero Basin, whose activity ended during the Lower Miocene. This deformation was accomplished under triaxial compression, Oligocene?Lower Miocene in age, marked by NW?SE to NNW?SSE shortening. Locally orientations of paleostresses deviate from that of the regional tensor, following a period of relative tectonic quiescence. During the Upper Miocene?Pliocene, a reactivation of constrictive stress occurred and some structures underwent rejuvenation as a consequence of the action of tectonic stresses similar to those of today (uniaxial extension to strike?slip with NW?SE shortening direction). However, the westernmost areas show continuous activity throughout the whole of the Tertiary, with no apparent pulses. At the present time there is a moderate seismic activity in the Central System related to faults that were active during the Cenozoic, with the same kinematic characteristics. "

This fault is characterized by a much smaller geomorphological signature than the South (or Perachora) fault of the same seismic sequence. Analysis of geodetic data on the basis of polynomial filtering and elastic dislocation modelling, as well as analysis of structural and coastal change data permits us to conclude that the upper bound in the uncertainty level of most of the available elevation changes is 20?30�cm, usually lower than the corresponding dislocation signal. In addition, the available geodetic data have a systematic pattern and are consistent with structural data. For this reason they permit more precise constraints on the geometry and the role of the Kapareli Fault (or the Alkyonides earthquakes North Fault): its total length is estimated about 17�km, about 50% longer than its surface trace; about 30?40�cm subsidence of its hanging wall, as well as at least 15�cm maximum uplift of its footwall is also inferred. This new evidence suggests that although in the long-term the Kapareli fault may represent a rather secondary, antithetic fault to the Alkyonides earthquakes South (Perachora) fault, during the 1981 earthquakes it probably had a more important structural role.

Hydrogeological and hydrochemical studies of these aquifers, with disregard to political boundaries, are scarce. The Lower Cretaceous Kurnub Group aquifer in Sinai and the Negev hosts paleowater mostly replenished during the Pleistocene. The objectives of this study are to elucidate the relationship between regional structural elements and the salinization of groundwater in the Kurnub Group in Sinai and further downstream in the Negev. The stable plateaus in southern Sinai and the fold structures in the north continuing into the Negev are separated by the W?E striking Minshara?Ramon shear zone. With the exception of higher salinities in the north, the chemical composition of Kurnub Group groundwater north and south of the shear zone is similar. Similarly, groundwater in the overlying Upper Cretaceous aquifer differs from Kurnub groundwater only within and north of the shear zone and is characterized by higher Cl concentrations, lower Mg/rCa ratios (due to high Ca in the calcareous aquifer) and by a ?heavier? isotopic signature. Inverse hydrogeochemical modeling using \{PHREEQC\} indicates that the increase in salinity of Kurnub groundwater within the shear zone and in adjacent areas could be due to two different sources: First, the salinization process could be the result of mixing with sulfate-rich brackish groundwater occurring in Jurassic formations, which are in fault-controlled lateral contact with the Kurnub Group aquifer. Second, the salinity differences could be from unflushed seawater in the subsurface of the northern Sinai and western Negev, i.e. possible remnants of the post-Messinian (Lower Pliocene) transgression, which penetrated into northern Sinai, the western Negev and the Coastal Plain of Israel both through erosional channels, which were incised during the Neogene, and by flooding over outcrops of permeable formations.

Here supercritical \{CO2\} has been injected at a rate of ? 1�MT/yr since 1996 and imaged by time-lapse seismic data in 1999, 2001 and 2002. The \{CO2\} rises as a narrow plume and is partially trapped by a number of thin mudstones before reaching the caprock to the reservoir. The radii of the individual layers of trapped \{CO2\} increase as the square root of time since initiation as predicted by the modelling for constant input flux. However apparent negative initiation times for horizons low in the reservoir suggests that net input fluxes for these layers have decreased with time, most probably as the spreading layers have increased their leakage rates. Accumulation of \{CO2\} in the layers higher in the reservoir was initiated up to 3�yr after injection started. Modelling of the thickness profiles across three of the higher layers suggests that their net input fluxes have increased with time. The observation that the central thicknesses of the deeper layers have remained approximately constant, or have slightly decreased since first imaged in 1999, is consistent with the model predictions that the central thickness is directly proportional to net input flux. However, estimates of the permeability of the reservoir from the rate of increase of the radii of the \{CO2\} accumulations are an order of magnitude less than measured permeabilities on the reservoir sandstone. Permeabilities estimated from the modelling of layer thickness changes scatter in the same range. These discrepancies may arise from, 1) approximations in the model not being valid, 2) the measured permeabilities not being representative of the permeability for two-phase flow on the scale of the reservoir or, considered less likely, 3) that much less \{CO2\} is being stored in the imaged \{CO2\} accumulations than estimated from the seismic reflection profiles. The most probable cause of the discrepancy is that the relative permeability for the \{CO2\} phase is significantly reduced at lower \{CO2\} saturations. "

abstract = "Reconnaissance level geomorphological observations in the northern part of Evia (Euboea) Island, suggest that a major topographic feature, the 17 km long and 15 km wide Nileas depression (NDpr), corresponds to a previously undetected graben structure, bounded by fault zones of ENE?WSW to NE?SW general strike. These fault zones have been active in the Quaternary, since they affect the Neogene deposits of the Limni?Histiaia basin. They strike transverse to the NW?SE active fault zones that bound northern Evia in the specific area and are characterised along most of their length by subtle geomorphic signatures in areas of extensive forest cover and poor exposure. The \{NDpr\} was formed during the Early?Middle Quaternary, after the deposition of the Neogene basin fill. During the Middle?Late Quaternary, the NW?SE fault zones that bound northern Evia have been the main active structures, truncating and uplifting the \{NDpr\} to a perched position in relation to the northern Gulf of Evia graben and the submarine basin on the Aegean side of the island. The present-day morphology of the NDpr, with an interior (floor) comprised of Middle Pleistocene erosional surfaces extensively dissected by drainages, was shaped by erosion during this uplift. Judging from their geomorphic signatures, the fault zones that bound the \{NDpr\} must have been characterised by low or very low rates of activity during the Late Quaternary. Yet, that they may still be accommodating strain today is suggested by moderate earthquakes that have been recorded within the NDpr. The fault zone at the \{SE\} flank of the \{NDpr\} (Prokopi?Pelion fault zone) may be very important in terms of earthquake segmentation of the active NW?SE Dirfys fault zone that controls the Aegean coast of northern Evia, given that the intersection between the two presents striking morpho-structural similarities with the intersection of two fault zones with the same directions on the mainland (the Atalanti and Hyampolis fault zones), which is known to have acted as a barrier to the propagation of the Atalanti earthquake ruptures in 1894.

We described the tectonic evolution of the Anatolia?Aegean area in three main steps, before, during and after the formation of the NAF. We remark that the tectonic conditions that are assumed to have triggered the formation of the NAF, i.e. collision to the east and extension to the west, was already achieved before the onset of that strike-slip fault system. We also highlight that the formation of the \{NAF\} was accompanied by the uplift of the Turkish?Iranian plateau and by a surge of volcanism in the eastern Anatolia collisional area and probably by the acceleration of the Aegean trench retreat. We show tomographic images from global P-wave model of Piromallo and Morelli [C. Piromallo, A. Morelli, P wave tomography of the mantle under the Alpine?Mediterranean area, J. Geophys. Res. 108 (2003) doi: 10.1029/2002JB001757.] showing that the slab beneath the Bitlis collisional belt is not continuous and that its possible rupture pursues to the west at least up to Cyprus and possibly up to the eastern end of the Hellenic trench. All these observations suggest that the plate tectonic re-organization occurred in the Late Miocene?Early Pliocene in the region results from slab break-off in the Bitlis area and from its lateral propagation to the West. This idea is tested in analogue laboratory experiments, which confirm that the break of the slab under the collisional belt may trigger, (1) the acceleration of slab retreat to the west due to the increase in slab pull force, (2) the indentation of the continent in the collisional area and (3) produce the conditions that permit the lateral escape of material towards the west and the formation of the NAF.

Based on apatite and zircon fission-track (AFT and ZFT) and (U?Th)/He dating we observe variable slip rates across the brittle/ductile transition on Naxos. \{ZFT\} and \{AFT\} ages range from 11.8 � 0.8 to 9.7 � 0.8 Ma and 11.2 � 1.6 to 8.2 � 1.2 Ma and (U?Th)/He zircon and apatite ages are between 10.4 � 0.4 to 9.2 � 0.3 Ma and 10.7 � 1.0 to 8.9 � 0.6 Ma, respectively.

All ages consistently decrease northwards in the direction of hanging wall transport. Most of our new thermochronological results and associated thermal modeling more strongly support the scenario of an identical fault dip and a constant or slightly accelerating slip rate of ? 6?8 km Myr? 1 on the \{NPEFS\} across the brittle/ductile transition. Even the intrusion of a large granodiorite body into the narrowing fault zone at ? 12 Ma on Naxos does not seem to have affected the thermal structure of the area in a way that would significantly disturb the slip rate.

The applied methodology includes the study of outcrops, industrial seismic profiles, digital elevation models, topographic maps, and borehole data. Observations suggest that most of the neotectonic structures in the Pannonian Basin are related to the inverse reactivation of earlier faults formed mainly during the Miocene syn- and post-rift phases. Typical structures are folds, blind reverse faults, and transpressional strike-slip faults, although normal or oblique-normal faults are also present. These structures significantly controlled the evolution of landforms and the drainage pattern by inducing surface upwarping and river deflections. Our analyses do not support the postulated tectonic origin of some landforms, particularly that of the radial valley system in the western Pannonian Basin. The most important neotectonic strike-slip faults are trending to east-northeast and have dextral to sinistral kinematics in the south-western and central-eastern part of the studied area, respectively. The suggested along-strike change of kinematics within the same shear zones is in agreement with the fan-shaped recent stress trajectories and with the present-day motion of crustal blocks derived from \{GPS\} data.

In contrast to experiments on pure calcite and anhydrite, which deformed homogeneously to large strains (? ? 5), all experiments on calcite?anhydrite mixtures resulted in heterogeneous deformation at ? &gt; 1 and the formation of narrow localised bands in the microstructures at ? &gt; 4. In these bands, the amount of strain is at least twice as large as in the rest of the sample and individual grains of the same phase cluster and align, thereby forming microstructural layering similar to planar fabrics in natural mylonites. A switch in deformation mechanism in anhydrite from dislocation creep to diffusion creep and/or grain boundary sliding occurs simultaneously with strain localisation. It is concluded that deformation-induced heterogeneous phase distributions cause local strength differences initiating strain localisation in the calcite?anhydrite mixtures. The study suggests that the presence of two phases in combination with a change in deformation mechanism may be responsible for strain localisation in natural poly-mineralic mylonites. "

Lithologically, the western mountains can be correlated with the neritic limestones of the Bey Da?lar� unit of \{SW\} Turkey. The eastern mountains relate to the ophiolitic Antalya Nappe Complex. In addition to this lithological contrast, a deep-seated crustal difference, which is best reflected in gravimetry, relates to the mid-Tortonian Aksu thrust phase. After the Early?Middle Miocene eastward emplacement of the Lycian Nappes, the Serravallian?Tortonian stage was characterized by the development of an array of grabens with N120�E strikes, which occupied a vast continental area that extended from southern Aegean to southwestern Turkey. During the mid-Tortonian, the last phase of thrusting marked the onset of a different kinematic regime related to the westward rotation of the Anatolian platelet. This Late Miocene change marked the start of differential subsidence that resulted in the formation of the Anaximander Mountains and which is reflected by an unconformity surface between the Lower?Middle Miocene and Plio?Quaternary units. The Messinian?Quaternary period in the western part of the Anaximander Mountains was characterized by distributed sinistral shear parallel to N70�E, which was marked by the onset of an extension on N20�E-striking normal faults that formed long graben-like depressions. During the Pliocene, these basins were transected by N70�E-striking sinistral strike-slip fault zones, although continued crustal extension suggests deformation in transtension. The eastern part of the Anaximander Mountains is instead characterized by N150�E-striking normal and/or oblique normal fault zones, which lack significant evidence of strike-slip deformation. Close examination of newly calculated predicted relative plate motions between Africa (from NUVEL-1A) and Anatolia (from \{GPS\} measurements) indicates that plate motion vectors change rapidly at the junction between the Hellenic and Cyprus arcs because of the close proximity to the pole of Anatolian rotation. These calculations indicate that along both the eastern Hellenic Arc and the western Cyprus arcs (the Florence Rise), the relative motion between the Anatolian and African plates is sinistral. On the southern Florence Rise, deformation is characterized by pure left-lateral faulting, whereas farther northwest, in the eastern Anaximander Mountains, the component of strike-slip decreases. Although arc-normal convergence predicts the occurrence of thrust faulting, southwestward trench retreat also causes an extension internal to this outer-arc domain, such that the preexisting N120�E-striking thrust faults of the Aksu phase have been reactivated as normal to oblique normal faults during the Pliocene and Quaternary. The observed sinistral faulting on faults striking N70�E in the western mountains is consistent with the relative plate motion along the eastern Hellenic Arc and merges with the extensional domain in the eastern mountains.

This study deals with a new quantitative geomorphometric procedure, based on the multivariate statistical analysis of local topographic gradients within a part of north-central Crete. This method employs sets of computer algorithms that automatically extract and classify geomorphometric properties from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). This was done by evaluating the morphological setting around each pixel of the \{DEM\} along the eight azimuth directions. \{ISODATA\} unsupervised classification was implemented to generate 10 morphometric classes showing the spatial distribution of areas with a similar geomorphic scenario. Results revealed that this approach permitted a quick estimation of the spatial distribution of morphologically homogeneous terrain units.

The older parts of basins formed by E?W-trending faults and accumulated hemipelagic sediment. Younger active faulting trends \{NNW\} in the western part of the arc and \{ENE\} in the eastern arc. The ENE-trending faults record sinistral strike-slip motion broadly parallel to the convergence direction of the Aegean?Anatolian and African plates. The north?south faults in the western arc are similar to those on land in the south Peloponnese. Chronology is estimated from sedimentation rates in cores and from stacked progradational units on basin margins controlled by eustatic changes in sea level. The younger fault pattern developed at 0.6?0.8 Ma in the western and central arc, but progressively younger in the southeastern part of the arc. The older basin fill with E?W faults is of early Quaternary and Pliocene age. An older regional unconformity corresponds to an early Pleistocene unconformity in the Cretan basin. Particularly in the area east of Santorini, faulting has resulted in startling changes in palaeogeography, such that some areas were late Pliocene basins, positive features during the Pleistocene and then subsided 600 m in the last 0.2 Ma. Such rapid basin inversion resulted in uplift of stratified hemipelagic muds, which were deformed by creep or failure, so that debris flow deposits accumulated in valleys and ponded basins. These fundamental tectonic changes in the past two million years indicate that much of the deformation resulting from the interaction of the Eurasian, African and Anatolian?Aegean plates is taken up at the southern margin of the Aegean microplate, probably because subduction of the African plate has slowed as a result of collision of continental crust. Regional fault patterns are a consequence of spatially varying effects of subduction roll-back. "

In the northeast shallow-water algal-bryozoan calcarenites of Oligocene-Miocene age overlie either Cretaceous rudist limestones or volcanics. Further to the northeast, the stratigraphic gap increases as the Miocene limestone thins, and in the A.G.I.P. well Catania 10, Plio-Pleistocene sediments and volcanics directly overlie Upper Jurassic rocks. In the southwestern part of the Hyblean Plateau pelagic sediments occupy the Cretaceous-Miocene interval. They were deposited in a shallow basin dipping gently towards the southwest. The transition between the two zones is marked by much evidence of synsedimentary tectonic activity, such as widespread slumping and the development of megabreccias composed of Cretaceous and Eocene blocks. The palaeogeographic picture is one of carbonate reefs and volcanic seamounts developing in the Upper Cretaceous. They formed platforms, fault bounded to the west and southwest, from which were derived the detrital sediments found in the basin, and occasional spectacular gravity slides. In present-day terms the structural high probably corresponds to the northeastern margin of the Hyblean Plateau and in part to the (Siracusa) Syracuse-Malta Escarpment. The pattern is little changed in the Upper Miocene with volcanoclastics of phreatomagmatic origin, intercalated with coral bioherms, overlying algal-bryozoan calcarenites. Upper Tortonian-Lower Messinian limestones with a restricted fauna indicate a shallow-water environment which grades up into continental conditions. In the eastern Hyblean Plateau, the Tertiary sequence is capped by Pliocene submarine to subaerial mafic lava flows. Lower Pleistocene sediments consist of biocalcarenites and clays which fill deep graben delimited by Plio-Pleistocene faults, the inshore continuation of the Malta-Syracuse Escarpment system of faults. From a tectonic standpoint the Hyblean region, a gently deformed segment of the African continental margin, acted as a foreland during Tertiary times. A Cretaceous-Eocene tectonic phase was responsible for the palaeogeographic pattern which existed during most of the Cenozoic. The present pattern is the result of three main tectonic phases following the regional Upper Miocene uplift, of Early-Middle Pliocene, Plio-Pleistocene and middle Pleistocene-Recent age which influenced the tectonic evolution of the present Ionian coast and the Malta-Syracuse Escarpment.

abstract = "Air-gun and 3.5-kHz seismic profiles from the eastern Aegean Sea off Turkey show that the continental shelf of outer Izmir and Candarli bays is formed by several superimposed deltaic sequences. During times of lowered sea level associated with late Quaternary glaciations, deltas prograded seaward more than 60 km from their present positions. Foreset progradation ceased with the rise of sea level in interglacial and post-glacial times and deltas were reestablished far inland in drowned river valleys. These major transgressions resulted in unconformities within the superimposed prograded delta sequences. The most recent three unconformities are correlated with the beginning of oxygen isotope stages 5, 3 and 1, and provide chronostratigraphic markers for a detailed analysis of sedimentation patterns in the late Quaternary. The coastal shelf and basins are subsiding at an average rate of about 1 m per 1000 years. This tectonic subsidence manifests itself as widespread normal block faulting which can be related to the pre-Miocene structural framework of the region. "

Prior to this a more widely spaced system of Pliocene basins had existed. Each of the Quaternary basins has a half-graben geometry with a major NW-dipping fault on its southeast side. Previous studies of the 1971 Burdur earthquake, caused by movement on the fault bounding the Burdur Basin, have shown this fault to flatten slightly at depth. Deformation in the hangingwall of the fault controlling the Pliocene basin in the Burdur region suggests a planar fault geometry. It is suggested that the Pliocene fault rotated to its present shallow orientation, then became inactive and acted as a detachment, at depth, for the more recent Quaternary fault. Quaternary faults bounding the Burdur, Acig�l and Baklan basins have a sinistral strike-slip component, with slip vectors indicating extension in an NW-SE direction. This is at variance with regional N-S extension in western Turkey. A solution for this contrast is found by invoking block rotations about vertical axes in a deforming zone between the rapidly extending Aegean region to the west and the stable unstretched Anatolian Plateau to the east.

These parameters are of two categories. Parameters of the first category are useful for seismic hazard evaluation (a and b values of the frequency-magnitude relation, maximum earthquake magnitude, number of shocks larger than certain magnitude per year) while parameters of the second category are proper for describing the spatial distribution of Seismicity (mean return period, most probable magnitude in a certain time period, moment rate). Shallow Seismicity is highest along the convex side of the Hellenic arc but close to the coast (Ionian Islands, south Peloponnesus, south of Crete, south of Karpathos and Rhodos), in Central Greece (Patraikos-Corinthiakos-Evoikos gulfs, Thessalia) and along a seismic belt which includes the northwestern Anatolia fault zone, the northernmost part of the Aegean Sea and the Serbomacedonia zone. The intermediate depth seismic activity is distributed in two parts of the Benioff zone, which dips from the convex side (Eastern Mediterranean) to the concave side (Aegean Sea) of the Hellenic arc. The one part shows a low dip angle and includes earthquakes with focal depths between 70 km and 100 km. This part has a high seismicity (earthquake magnitudes up to 8.0) and is situated below the inner slope of the sedimentary part of the Hellenic arc (Eastern Peloponnesus-north of Crete-Rhodos). Based on the fact that this part of the Benioff zone is a continuation of the seismic zone of shallow earthquakes along the Hellenic arc and that both zones have the same seismicity, it is concluded that they constitute a continuous seismic belt on which coupling occurs between the subducted eastern Mediterranean lithosphere and the overthrusted Aegean lithosphere. The other (inner) part of the Benioff zone shows low seismicity (maximum earthquake magnitude up to 7.1) with earthquakes of focal depths between 100 km and 180 km. It dips at a mean angle of 38� below the volcanic arc of the southern Aegean Sea and is the result of the subduction of the front part of the eastern Mediterranean lithosphere without coupling with the Aegean lithosphere.

Remnants of the upper plate include low-P crystalline rocks and sediments which have been juxtaposed onto the lower-plate blueschists in several stages since the Early Miocene. The low-angle contacts operated as normal faults which removed the overburden from above the Cycladic blueschists. Detailed investigations on Tinos island indicate that the fractured blocks of the upper plate lying above a low-angle normal fault did not rotate. This shows that the faults initiated as rather gently dipping fractures. Similar structures were also reported from other blueschist terrains. Kinematic analysis of such flat-lying faults implies that the synmetamorphic overburden should be mostly located several hundred kilometers away from the present exposure of the blueschists. Considering that the Cycladic blueschist belt exposes successively shallower units in the west, and that rocks of the upper plate have an Anatolian nature, we suggest that these blueschists were dragged from beneath Turkey. We recognize that the blueschist unit has undergone further thrusting in the final stage of the exhumation, as have its counterparts elsewhere in the Hellenides. The emergence of the blueschists in the Tertiary was concomitant with continental collision and thrusting in the Hellenides. The operation of low-angle normal faults with large extensional displacements occurred within this context of collision tectonics. This extension occurred parallel to the strike of the convergent orogen. "

The work performed by this ?gravitational tectonics stress? must have formerly existed as gravitational potential energy contained in the stress-causing density structure. According to the elastic rebound theory (Reid, 1910), the energy of earthquakes comes from an elastic strain field built up by fairly continuous elastic deformation in the period between events. For earthquakes resulting from gravitational tectonic stress, the elastic rebound theory requires the transfer of energy from the gravitational potential of the density structures into an elastic strain field prior to the event. An alternate theory involves partial gravitational collapse of the stress-causing density structures. The earthquake energy comes directly from a net decrease in gravitational potential energy. The gravitational potential energy released at the time of the earthquake is split between the energy released by the earthquake, including work done in the fault zone and an increase in stored elastic strain energy. The stress associated with this elastic strain field should oppose further fault slip. "

During the Late Pliocene, well before the onset of Quaternary glaciation, the subsidence rate in the southern part of the North Sea basin showed a ten-fold increase relative to previous Tertiary rates. The high Pliocene-Quaternary subsidence rate is consistent with the direction and state of the present intraplate stress field in Northwest Europe. One possible consequence of the modern compressional stress field in Northwest Europe is reactivation of faulting in the Central Graben resulting in localized stretching and the development of pull-apart basins. Alternatively, the acceleration in Late Pliocene subsidence rates could be due to localized flexural downwarping of the lithosphere in the Central Graben caused by an increase in the level of intraplate compression. Both mechanisms succesfully predict the major characteristics of the overall Quaternary subsidence history and stratigraphy. Gravity modeling suggests that the mechanism of localized stretching dominates the recent tectonostratigraphic evolution of the southern North Sea. "

Major listric faulting characterises the southern margin of the basin and the wide northern flank represents an associated downbend or reverse drag structure with antithetic faulting. Magmatism may occur in the axial zone of the basin. The Sporadhes basin has been formed in a late Cenozoic tensile stress regime and its evolution is discussed in terms of the regional tectonics and the process of back-arc extension.

The presence of a well-defined sedimentary basin (lying between the Strabo- and Pliny Trench), where evaporitic strata exist but where the acoustic facies also suggest coarse fill, is probably derived from surrounding topographical highs exposed to erosion during the Messinian.

Along-strike disruptions in the continuity of fault scarps (step-over zones, step-up zones, step-down zones, footwall cross-faults and hangingwall cross-faults) are products of perturbations in slip-plane geometry or intersections with transverse faults. Large-scale variations in range-front morphology reflect contrasting patterns of deformation within fault zones. Some major fault zones, and many minor fault zones, are characterized by a migration of the active slip plane towards the hangingwall, resulting in a distributed network of high-angle faults and a range front which is stepped in profile. The presence of a localized mass of uneroded bedrock (hangingwall salients) protruding from the hangingwall of some major fault zones, results in intense deformation along a principal slip plane, and a range front which is ramp-like in profile. As a consequence of structural heterogeneities within neotectonic normal fault zones, fault scarps and range fronts in the Aegean region are subject to a temporally and spatially variable pattern of degradation.

The direction of simple shear in the hanging wall block is arbitrary and has a dramatic effect on the predicted fault or bedding geometry. There is no reason to believe that the simple shear occurs on vertical planes, as is commonly assumed in graphical approaches to this problem, and ignoring the presence of inclined simple shear is likely to lead to considerable underestimates of the amount of extension across normal faults and in the amount of shortening across thrusts. Similar though more complicated expressions can be obtained when compaction within the hanging wall block is taken into account. For a planar normal fault such compaction may result in the development of a hanging wall syncline. "

Most flysch studies suggest that this type of deposit accumulates in deep (?deep?, to most workers, implies below shelf break or deeper than neritic) elongate basins. This examination of modern basins sheds light on this problem. The eastern Mediterranean basin plains, except those off the Nile Cone, are bounded by slopes that exceed 3� and in some cases 40�; the topographic characteristics and distribution of these basins reflect the intense structural activity in this region. Depths in the Aegean Sea range from less than 200 to over 2500 m (basin plain area range from 10?1380 km2); plains in the Sea of Crete are less elongate than those in other provinces. Depressions south of the Peloponnesus-Crete-Rhodes island arc include a number of long, very narrow (1?3 km wide) trenches that are generally small (25?200 km2) and deep (&gt; 300 m). The largest depressions, the Herodotus and Sirte abyssal plains, south of the Mediterranean Ridge also exceed 3000 m. Although most basins occur at depths exceeding 1000 m, there are excellent examples of shallower (&lt; 300 m) turbidite sand and mud sequences in basins and base-of-slope environments in the Aegean. Vertical tectonic movement locally exceeds rates of sediment accumulation resulting in structural lowering of deposits into deeper water. Observations in the modern Mediterranean serve to refine paleogeographic interpretation of ancient flysch. "

The various types of gravitative mass movements that have been documented include: (i) sliding of large masses with no or only slight internal deformation, (ii) sliding of masses with disintegration of the sediment fabric to debris flows and (iii) slow downslope creep. The mass movements are associated with fault escarpments, delta fronts and well-stratified slopes with slope gradients ranging from 2 to 40�. Earthquakes seem to be the main mechanism initiating mass movement, but other mechanisms such as increasing topographic gradient, gas in the sediment pores and heavy rain, can also independently trigger and/or contribute to the initiation of mass movements.

abstract = "The Aegean continental domain is known to be the site of widespread ?back-arc? extension since at least the Middle Miocene, overprinting structures related to the Mesozoic-Cenozoic Hellenic orogeny. Features attributed to early thrusting include the overall ductile deformation within two broad belts that have suffered HP/LT metamorphism across the Aegean. This study summarizes the results of a structural study in the central Aegean area (Cyclades and Evvia Island), examining in particular the relationship between ductile and brittle deformation on a regional scale. Extension appears to be responsible for most of the ductile deformation within \{HP\} rock units that have experienced penetrative greenschist-facies and higher-grade metamorphic overprinting. On each island studied, progressive extensional deformation has occurred through the development of a major normal-sense detachment zone down to depths of about 18?25 km. The geometry of the extensional system on the scale of the central Aegean is described, taking into account the characteristic features of the regional-scale ductile strain field. At least two-probably three-subparallel major north-dipping detachment zones are identified, trending NW-SE in the northwestern Cyclades and E-W in the southeastern Cyclades, both with initial dips estimated at around 30?45�. The present geometry of the extensional system implies that these detachment zones and related metamorphic core complexes interfere with each other. Two main evolutionary models are considered which can account for such a kinematic link between parallel detachment zones. Structural data favour the sequential development of synthetic major detachments zones in a direction opposite to the sense of dip of the detachments. Early (?Oligocene-Lower Miocene) detachment-type extension in the area studied is related to a late-orogenic post-thickening ?back-arc? setting. "

abstract = "It is proposed that major continental collision normally causes two orogenies. The first is characterized by ophiolite obduction, and the second by widespread deformation, often accompanied by metamorphism and granite intrusion. The two orogenies are separated by a relatively quiescent orogenic pause of 40?60 Ma. The two stages of continental collision are illustrated by examples from the Paleozoic Newfoundland Appalachians, and the Mesozoic-Cenozoic Tethyan collision belts of the Zagros and Himalayas. The stages of continental collision are explained in terms of the forces driving plate motions, which are dominated by the downward pull of subducting oceanic lithosphere and, to a lesser extent, by the outward push of spreading oceanic ridges. The Taconic stage marks attempted subduction of continental crust. The buoyancy of continental crust offsets the negative buoyancy of subducting oceanic lithosphere and other driving forces so that plate motion is halted. Orogeny involves vertical buoyancy forces and is concentrated along the narrow belt of plate overlap at the subduction zone. In a major collision the Taconic stage destroys a substantial proportion of the earth's subducting capacity. It is an event of such magnitude that it has global consequences, reducing sea-floor spreading and the rate of convection. This results in retention of heat within the earth and a consequent increase in the forces driving the plates. The orogenic pause represents the time taken for these forces to become strong enough to overcome the obstruction of buoyant continental crust and renew subduction at the collision zone. The Acadian stage of collision occurs when renewed subduction is achieved by detachment of continental crust from its underlying lithosphere. As the subcrustal lithosphere is subducted, the crust moves horizontally. The result is crustal shortening with widespread deformation and generation of anatectic granitic magma, as well as subduction related volcanism. The effects of continental collision on the rate of sea-floor spreading can be related to eustatic changes in sea level, glaciations, and mass extinctions. There may also be connections, through changes in the rate of mantle convection, to the earth's magnetic polarity bias and rotation rate. "

abstract = "The purpose of this paper is to examine the kinematic behaviour of normal fault systems and see what general conditions govern their geometrical evolution. We pay particular attention to seismological and surface data from regions of present day active normal faulting, as the instantaneous three-dimensional geometry at the time of fault movement is better known in active regions than in areas where the faults are now static. Most normal faults are concave upward, or listric. This shape can be produced by geometric constraints, either because the faults reactivate curved thrusts, or because they must be curved to accommodate rotations. Another effect which will produce curved faults is the variation of rheology with depth: brittle failure at shallow depths produces less fault rotation than does distributed creep in the lower part of the crust. An important geometric feature of normal faulting is the uplift of the footwall. The amount of such uplift is related not only to the elastic properties of the lithosphere, but also to the throw and dip of the fault. A striking feature of active normal faults is that they occur in groups in which all the faults dip in the same direction. This behaviour arises because the faults cannot intersect: if they do, one must cease to be active. The rotation which such fault systems produce reduces the dip of the faults until a new steeply dipping fault is formed. Once a new fault cuts pre-existing faults the earlier faults become locked, and a new set of faults must propagate rapidly across the whole region involved. Many of these geometric constraints also apply to thrust faulting. "

Nevertheless recently, most authors have recognized extensional structures within Middle to Upper Miocene granitoids, proposing a Basin and Range type model for the Late Cenozoic evolution of the area. To resolve this problem, structural mapping and mesoscopic analysis of 900 faults sampled from 12 islands have been carried out. Late orogenic uplift of the central Aegean region is the result of a continuous convergence and indentation of the Pelagonian plate by the Apulian plate, that took place throughout the Miocene. Formation of core-complexes can be associated with: (a) large oblique-upthrusts, (b) steeply dipping strike-slip faults, and (c) low-angle normal faults. The latter are produced by low, multidirectional extension, which has affected small crustal regions as adjacent areas underwent transpression. In the late stages of collision the overthickened crust began to collapse due to transtension which was replaced by extension caused by the roll-back of the Hellenic subduction zone in the Lower Pliocene time. This extensional regime has lasted until the present day. "

Concentrating on relay zones and segmented normal fault arrays, we suggest that very different interpretations of their evolution arise from the recognition that the propagation directions of faults, and fault segments, will rarely be contained within the inspection plane of 2-D data. A 3-D perspective favours an interpretation in which the segments of a fault array are kinematically interrelated from their initiation. Individual segments in such systems may link into a single fault surface out of the plane of inspection or may be unconnected in 3-D. We argue that this interpretation, which conflicts with the often suggested model of incidental overlap of originally isolated faults, should be the preferred model for the generation and growth of segmented normal fault arrays.

The history of ?18O change in planktonic foraminifera reflects the changing isotopic composition and temperature of seawater at the time of test formation. Changes in the isotopic composition of benthonic foraminifera largely reflect changes in the volume of continental ice. Isotopic data from these cores indicates the following sequence of events related to continental glaciation:(1) A permanent Antarctic ice sheet developed late in the Middle Miocene (about 13 to 11.5 m.y. ago). (2) The Late Miocene (about 11.5 to 5 m.y. ago) is marked by significant variation in ?18O of about 0.5? throughout, indicating instability of Antarctic ice cap size or bottom-water temperatures. (3) The early Pliocene (5 to about 3 m.y. ago) was a time of relative stability in ice volume and bottom-water temperature. (4) Growth of permanent Northern Hemisphere ice sheets is inferred to have begun about 3 m.y. ago. (5) The late Pliocene (3 to about 1.8 m.y. ago) is marked by one major glaciation or bottom-water cooling dated between about 2.1 to 2.3 m.y. (6) There is some evidence that the frequency of glacial-interglacial cycles increased at about 0.9 m.y. There is significant variation in ?13C at these sites but no geochemical interpretation is offered in this paper. The most outstanding feature of ?13C results is a permanent shift of about ?0.8? found at about 6.5 m.y. in east equatorial and central north Pacific benthonic foraminifera. This benthonic carbon shift may form a useful marker in deep-sea cores recovering Late Miocene carbonates. "

abstract = "Resistance of modern oceanic tectosphere to the initiation of subduction can be evaluated by considering its flexural rigidity, shear resistance in the subduction zone, and the negative buoyancy force, after McKenzie [13]. These depend on the effective elastic thickness, the depth to which shear stresses are appreciable, and the tectospheric thickness respectively. Evaluation of these thicknesses and their variation with age allows development of a model in which oceanic tectosphere becomes progressively less stable with increasing age and spontaneously subducts at an age of 200 Ma. The same model applied to early Proterozoic oceanic tectosphere, distinguished only by having sub-tectosphere temperatures 100�C higher than in the modern, rquires that Proterozoic ocean tectosphere subduct spontaneously at ages of about 75 Ma. The subduction of universally young oceanic tectosphere inhibits the production of juvenile magmas, due to the release of volatiles from the descending slab at low pressures, near the trench. The model therefore accounts for the scarcity of subduction-related magmas in many early Proterozoic orogens. It also predicts that ocean basins opening in the early Proterozoic should have generally limited width, that blueschist metamorphism should be rare and that early Proterozoic oceanic crust should rarely be preserved at the earth's surface. With progressive cooling of the mantle the Proterozoic tectonic scheme may have changed gradually into the modern one by early Phanerozoic time, although parts of the pan-African system may exhibit the characteristics of still unstable oceanic tectosphere.

For the analysed Milos lavas (dacite-rhyolite) there is no correlation between87Sr/86Sr and any major or trace element concentration and this, together with the fact that the87Sr/86Sr ratios are similar to those of basaltic andesites and andesites from Aegina and Methana in the northwestern part of the arc, likewise indicates that the87Sr/86Sr ratios are identical to those of the parental magmas from which the lava series was derived (also by fractional crystallization). The relatively high87Sr/86Sr ratios of the Santorini and Milos parental magmas indicate that terrigenous material has played a role in their genesis. This could be either via the subduction process or by assimilation of lower crustal material during ascent of mantle-derived magmas.

The data suggest that there are two generations of metal, one with low, the other with high concentrations of refractory siderophiles.

We infer that Sc and Mn are located largely in the niningerite ((Fe,Mg)S), V in the troilite (FeS) and rare earth elements in the oldhamite (CaS). Heterogeneities among the clasts are probably primary, resulting from the accretion-agglomeration process, although shock processes in a regolithic setting remain a possibility provided that they were followed by a period of metamorphism sufficient to erase petrologic evidence. In the dark inclusions the concentrations of the rare earths, Eu excepted, are 4 � higher than mean \{EH\} levels; this infers enhanced amounts of CaS. The dark inclusions are low in siderophiles, Sc, Mn, K, Na and Al, implying low amounts of metal, niningerite and feldspar.

In this situation presolar aggregations of grains would melt to form chondrules. Many of the properties of chondrules (and also CAI's) are consistent with their formation by this means. The infall heating concept provides a new framework in which the formation and significance of chondritic meteorites can be understood. "

abstract = "Dismembered ophiolites occur in the Dinaride Ophiolite Zone (DOZ) that is related to the open-ocean Tethyan realm, whereas highly dismembered ophiolites occur in the Vardar Zone (VZ) related to a back-arc basin. The ophiolites of \{DOZ\} are associated with a Jurassic olistostrome m�lange (DOZM), the youngest component of which are Tithonian limestone exotics and with the Mesozoic bed-to-bed Radiolarite Formation. Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous to Late Cretaceous clastic sequences, comprising redeposited fragments of ophiolites, disconformably overlie the DOZM. Ophiolites of \{VZ\} are associated with tectonized ophiolite m�lange (VZM), the youngest component of which are Late Cretaceous?Paleogene limestone exotics. The \{VZM\} is associated with the Late Cretaceous?Paleogene flysch formation. Ophiolites of both the \{DOZ\} and the \{VZ\} are predominantly peridotite tectonites, represented mainly by fertile spinel lherzolite in the western and central part of \{DOZ\} and VZ, and by depleted harzburgites in their southeastern parts. Cumulate ultramafics and gabbros are subordinate and are in some places overlain by massive or sheeted dyke complexes, capped by metabasaltic pillow lavas. Metamorphic soles of ophiolites are represented by varieties of amphibolites with subordinate pyroxenite schists and scarce eclogites with ultramafic interlayers, which were progressively metamorphosed under P?T conditions of eclogite (?), granulite, amphibolite and greenschist facies. The according protoliths are cumulate gabbros in the DOZ, medium-grade bimineralic epidote?amphibolite facies amphibolites derived from diabase?dolerites, and low- to medium-grade metapelites and metapsammites. K?Ar and Sm?Nd measurements yield ages of 174�14?136�15 Ma on ophiolites from \{DOZ\} and 109.6�6.6?62.2�2.5 Ma on ophiolites from VZ. Basic petrological and geochemical features for all Dinaridic ophiolites and associated amphibolites are correlatively presented both for \{DOZ\} and VZ. Dinaridic ophiolites were generated in the Dinaridic Tethys over the period of about 150 Ma. The bulk of oceanic crust was generated during the Late Triassic to pre-Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous when oceanic subduction processes, accompanied by \{DOZ\} ophiolite obduction onto the Apulian margin, started. Generation of the oceanic crust continued during the Cretaceous?Early Paleogene in a reduced Dinaridic Tethys under back-arc setting. Eocene closure of the Dinaridic Tethys was accompanied by the second emplacement of \{VZ\} ophiolites and the final structuration of the Dinarides and their uplift. At the end, geological and petrological similarities and dissimilarities of ophiolites from both \{DOZ\} and \{VZ\} are presented. "

abstract = "Metagabbros in the core series of the Menderes Massif, for some time considered as post orogenic Miocene intrusives, revealed a strong poly-metamorphic history. The metagabbro bodies exhibit a pronounced zonation. Within their cores, igneous minerals are still preserved. Coronitic textures are interpreted as results of a high temperature, possibly granulitic overprint. The outer parts of the metagabbro bodies mostly consist of strongly to completely retrograded garnet-amphibolites, but occasionally contain relics of eclogites. Petrologic investigations confirmed a high pressure overprint and allowed preliminary P, T estimates (650�C, ? 1.3 GPa). The intensity of the \{HP\} metamorphism seems to rise from south to north within the Menderes basement, thus pointing to a northward subduction as the cause. The age of the high pressure event still awaits clarification. However, its very existence reanimates the question, how close the relationship between Menderes and the Cyclades evolution might have been. "
